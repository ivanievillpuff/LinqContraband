## 🚀 Installation

Install via NuGet. No configuration required.

```bash
dotnet add package LinqContraband
```

The analyzer will immediately start scanning your code for contraband.

## 👮‍♂️ The Rules

### LC001: The Local Method Smuggler

When EF Core encounters a method it can't translate, it might switch to client-side evaluation (fetching all rows) or throw a runtime exception. This turns a fast SQL query into a massive memory leak.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine hiring a translator to translate a book into Spanish, but you used made-up slang words they don't know. They can't finish the job, so they hand you the *entire* dictionary and say "You figure it out." You have to read the whole dictionary just to find one word.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
// CalculateAge is a local C# method. EF Core doesn't know SQL for it.
var query = db.Users.Where(u => CalculateAge(u.Dob) > 18);
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Extract the logic outside the query.

```csharp
var minDob = DateTime.Now.AddYears(-18);
var query = db.Users.Where(u => u.Dob <= minDob);
```

---

### LC002: Premature Materialization

This is the "Select *" of EF Core. By materializing early, you transfer the entire table over the network, discard 99% of it in memory, and keep the Garbage Collector busy.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine you want a pepperoni pizza. Instead of ordering just pepperoni, you order a pizza with *every single topping in the restaurant*. When it arrives, you have to spend an hour picking off the anchovies, pineapple, and mushrooms before you can eat. It’s a waste of food and time.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
// ToList() executes the query (SELECT * FROM Users).
// Where() then filters millions of rows in memory.
var query = db.Users.ToList().Where(u => u.Age > 18);
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Filter on the database, then materialize.

```csharp
// SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age > 18
var query = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 18).ToList();
```

---

### LC003: Prefer Any() over Count() > 0

Count() > 0 forces the database to scan all matching rows to return a total number (e.g., 5000). Any() generates IF EXISTS (...), allowing the database to stop scanning after finding just one match.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine you want to know if there are any cookies left in the jar. Count() > 0 is like dumping the entire jar onto the table and counting 500 cookies one by one just to say "Yes". Any() is like opening the lid, seeing one cookie, and saying "Yes" immediately.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
// Counts 1,000,000 rows just to see if one exists.
if (db.Users.Count() > 0) { ... }
```

**✅ The Fix:**

```csharp
// Checks IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 ...)
if (db.Users.Any()) { ... }
```

---


### LC005: Multiple OrderBy Calls
This is a logic bug that acts like a performance bug. The second OrderBy completely ignores the first. The database creates a sorting plan for the first column, then discards it to sort by the second.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine telling someone to sort a deck of cards by Suit (Hearts, Spades...). As soon as they finish, you say "Actually, sort them by Number (2, 3, 4...) instead." They did all that work for the first sort for nothing because you changed the rules.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
// Sorts by Name, then immediately discards it to sort by Age.
var query = db.Users.OrderBy(u => u.Name).OrderBy(u => u.Age);
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Chain them properly.

```csharp
var query = db.Users.OrderBy(u => u.Name).ThenBy(u => u.Age);
```

---

### LC006: Cartesian Explosion Risk

If User has 10 Orders, and Order has 10 Items, fetching all creates 100 rows per User. With 1000 Users, that's 100,000 rows transferred. `AsSplitQuery` fetches Users, Orders, and Items in 3 separate, clean queries.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine a teacher asks 30 students what they ate. Instead of getting 30 answers, she asks every student to list every single fry they ate individually. You end up with thousands of answers ("I ate fry #1", "I ate fry #2") instead of just "I had fries".

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
// Fetches Users * Orders * Roles rows.
var query = db.Users.Include(u => u.Orders).Include(u => u.Roles).ToList();
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Use `.AsSplitQuery()` to fetch related data in separate SQL queries.

```csharp
// Fetches Users, then Orders, then Roles (3 queries).
var query = db.Users.Include(u => u.Orders).AsSplitQuery().Include(u => u.Roles).ToList();
```

---

### LC007: N+1 Looper

Database queries have high fixed overhead (latency, connection pooling). Executing 100 queries takes ~100x longer than executing 1 query that fetches 100 items.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine you need 10 eggs. You drive to the store, buy *one* egg, drive home. Drive back, buy *one* egg, drive home. You do this 10 times. You spend all day driving instead of just buying the carton at once.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
foreach (var id in ids)
{
    // Executes 1 query per ID. Latency kills you here.
    var user = db.Users.Find(id);
}
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Fetch data in bulk outside the loop.

```csharp
// Executes 1 query for all IDs.
var users = db.Users.Where(u => ids.Contains(u.Id)).ToList();
```

---

### LC008: Sync-over-Async

In web apps, threads are a limited resource. Blocking a thread to wait for SQL (I/O) means that thread can't serve other users. Under load, this causes "Thread Starvation", leading to 503 errors even if CPU is low.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine a waiter taking your order, then walking into the kitchen and staring at the chef for 20 minutes until the food is ready. No one else gets served. That's Sync-over-Async. Async means the waiter takes the order and goes to serve other tables while the food cooks.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
public async Task<List<User>> GetUsersAsync()
{
    // Blocks the thread while waiting for DB.
    return db.Users.ToList();
}
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Use the Async counterpart and await it.

```csharp
public async Task<List<User>> GetUsersAsync()
{
    // Frees up the thread while waiting.
    return await db.Users.ToListAsync();
}
```

---

### LC009: The Tracking Tax

EF Core takes a "snapshot" of every entity it fetches to detect changes. For a read-only dashboard, this snapshot process consumes CPU and doubles the memory usage for every row.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine you go to a museum. You promise not to touch anything. But security guards still follow you and take high-resolution photos of every painting you look at, just in case you decide to draw a mustache on one. It wastes their time and memory.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
public List<User> GetUsers()
{
    // EF Core tracks these entities, but we never modify them.
    return db.Users.ToList();
}
```

**✅ The Fix:**
Add `.AsNoTracking()` to the query.

```csharp
public List<User> GetUsers()
{
    // Pure read. No tracking overhead.
    return db.Users.AsNoTracking().ToList();
}
```

---

### LC010: SaveChanges Loop Tax

Opening and committing a database transaction is an expensive operation. Doing this inside a loop (e.g., for 100 items) means 100 separate transactions, which can be 1000x slower than a single batched commit.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine mailing 100 letters. Instead of putting them all in the mailbox at once, you put one in, wait for the mailman to pick it up, then put the next one in. It takes 100 days to mail your invites!

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
foreach (var user in users)
{
    user.LastLogin = DateTime.Now;
    // Opens a transaction and commits for EVERY user.
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```

**✅ The Fix:**

Batch the changes and save once.

```csharp
foreach (var user in users)
{
    user.LastLogin = DateTime.Now;
}
// One transaction, one roundtrip.
db.SaveChanges();
```

---

### LC011: Entity Missing Primary Key

Entities in EF Core require a Primary Key to track identity. If you don't define one, EF Core might throw a runtime exception or prevent you from updating the record later.

**👶 Explain it like I'm a ten year old:** Imagine a library where books have no titles or ISBN numbers. You ask for a book, but because there's no unique way to identify it, the librarian can't find it, or worse, gives you the wrong one.

**❌ The Crime:**

```csharp
public class Product 
{
    // No 'Id', 'ProductId', or [Key] attribute defined.
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

**✅ The Fix:**

Define a primary key using the `Id` convention, `[Key]` attribute, or Fluent API.

```csharp
// 1. Convention: Id or {ClassName}Id
public class Product 
{
    public int Id { get; set; } 
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

// 2. Attribute: [Key]
public class Product 
{
    [Key]
    public int ProductCode { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

// 3. Fluent API (in OnModelCreating)
modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().HasKey(p => p.ProductCode);

// 4. Separate Configuration (IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>)
public class ProductConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Product>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Product> builder)
    {
        builder.HasKey(p => p.ProductCode);
    }
}
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can configure the severity of these rules in your `.editorconfig` file:

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.LC001.severity = error
dotnet_diagnostic.LC002.severity = error
dotnet_diagnostic.LC003.severity = warning
```
